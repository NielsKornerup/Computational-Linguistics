I took all of my computational linguistic problems from LASACTF and turned them into a format that is easier to read. In the near future, I plan to add a third file to each problem explaining how the language works. Once I have more time, I might turn this into a website for hosting these types of problems. If you enjoy my problems, please star this repository so that I can share them with more people. If you want to write up a solution guide for any of these problems/make a document describing how the language work, feel free to do that as well. Also, feel free to add your own computational linguistics problems to this repository!
