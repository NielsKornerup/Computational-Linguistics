*Weird Counting*
===
This language is based on the prime factorization of numbers. Notice how each prime number follows basically the same pattern: `fa` followed by a number of `zo`'s.

Each syllable corresponds to the exponent in a number's prime factorization, according to the following table:

| syllable | number |
|----------|--------|
| zo       | 0      |
| fa       | 1      |
| la       | 2      |
| sa       | 3      |
| na       | 4      |

The order of the syllables corresponds to each prime number in order, i.e. 2, 3, 5, 7...

For example, the number 45 can be written as 5<sup>1</sup>*3<sup>2</sup>*2<sup>0</sup>, so in this language, it would be written as falazo. Notice how each syllable corresponds to its prime exponent.

To answer the problem <i>What is nalazofa in base 10?</i> we just reverse the process. <i>nalazofa</i> corresponds to 7<sup>4</sup>*5<sup>2</sup>*3<sup>0</sup>*2<sup>1</sup>. Now we simply need to do the math, which results in 120050.
